# Filler
be aggressive!!!!

Create player to fight other students on the world famous (or infamous) Filler board.
The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other,
the game piece obtained by the game master (in the form of an executable Ruby program).
The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore.

How to start the game:

1. Use Makefile;

2. Makefile creates executable "arepnovs_filler" (player in game) and executable "colorme" for coloring the output of game;

2. Go to resourses;

3. Run next command: ./filler_vm -p1 path to player1] -p2 [path to player2] -v -f maps/[chose map];

4. To enable coloring of output add "| colorme" to the previous command;

5. ???

6. arepnovs_filler wins:)*;

*except the situations, when the game-master program gives impossible for placement piece**.

**it happens, but not very often.
